# Deepfake Detection using Frame and Temporal Features

This repository contains a project for detecting deepfake videos using machine learning techniques. The approach combines **frame-based**, **temporal**, and **combined** features extracted from video data to classify videos as real or fake.

---

## Project Overview

The goal is to build a robust binary classifier that leverages visual (frame) and motion (temporal) patterns from video embeddings to detect deepfakes effectively.
