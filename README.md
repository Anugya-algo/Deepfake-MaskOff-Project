# Deepfake Detection using Frame and Temporal Features
This project explores the problem of deepfake video detection using deep learning. The core objective is to classify whether a video is real or deepfake based on extracted frame-level, temporal, and combined features.

---

## Project Overview

The goal is to build a robust binary classifier that leverages visual (frame) and motion (temporal) patterns from video embeddings to detect deepfakes effectively.
